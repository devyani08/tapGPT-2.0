## ⚠️Under Review⚠️

1. Service worker registration failed. Status code: 15: This error message indicates that the service worker script could not be registered successfully. The status code of 15 is not a standard HTTP status code, and it is not clear what it means in this context. One possible cause of service worker registration failure is that the service worker script is not being served from the correct location or with the correct MIME type1. You can try checking the location and MIME type of your service worker script to ensure that they are correct.

2. Uncaught ReferenceError: document is not defined: This error message indicates that the document object is not defined in the current context. The document object is a property of the window object and represents the HTML document that is currently loaded in the window. This error can occur if you are trying to access the document object from a context where it is not available, such as a service worker or a background page2. You can try checking your code to ensure that you are only accessing the document object from a context where it is available.

3. Unchecked runtime.lastError: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.: This error message indicates that a connection could not be established between different parts of your extension, such as between a popup and a background page. This can happen if one of the parts is not listening for messages, or if there is an issue with the message passing code3. You can try checking your message passing code to ensure that it is correctly set up and that all parts of your extension are listening for messages.

4. Access to fetch at 'https://api.openai.com/v1/endpoint' from origin 'chrome-extension://npndimfikeaeikadlbcmgdgdginehehf' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: It does not have HTTP ok status.: This error message indicates that a request made using the fetch API was blocked by the browser’s Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy4. CORS is a security feature that allows servers to specify which origins are allowed to access their resources. In this case, it appears that the server at https://api.openai.com/v1/endpoint did not return an HTTP OK status in response to the preflight request, which caused the request to be blocked. You can try checking the server’s response to ensure that it is correctly configured to allow requests from your extension’s origin.

5. TypeError: Failed to fetch: This error message indicates that a call to the fetch function failed. This can happen for several reasons, such as network issues or problems with the server being requested5. In this case, it appears that this error may be related to the previous CORS error, as the failed fetch call was attempting to access the same URL.
